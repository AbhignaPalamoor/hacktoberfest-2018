# What the `git`?

<em>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed
to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
efficiency.</em>

I don't need say much but simply put git is a tool to keep track of the stuff
that you do. When you tell it to, git keps track of the changes made to your
stuff and to version control your stuff. The _stuff_ can be anything, files,
folders, anything.
